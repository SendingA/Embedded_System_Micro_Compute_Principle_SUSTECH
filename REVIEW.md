### Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Communication

 Synchronous Communication 

• Shares the same clock signal, which is sent along with data; 

• The device that generates the clock is called the **master** and other devices are **slaves** 

 Asynchronous Communication 

• no clock transmitted, fewer wires 

• it relies on **synchronous signals** like start and stop bits within the data signal
